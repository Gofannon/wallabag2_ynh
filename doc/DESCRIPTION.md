Wallabag is a self hostable Read-It-Later application allowing you to not miss any content anymore. Click, save, read it when you can.
It provides a web interface, browser (Firefox/Chrome/Opera) add-ons, mobile apps (Android/iOS/Windows Phone) and even on e-reader (PocketBook/Kobo).

Upgrade from the YunoHost [Wallabag v1](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/wallabag_ynh) app requires a manual operation. That's why it's provided as a new package. For the migration process, please refer to the [Wallabag official documentation](https://doc.wallabag.org/en/user/import/wallabagv1.html).
